    Why Python programming is awesome (don’t forget to tweet today, with the hashtag #pythoniscool :))
    What’s the difference between errors and exceptions
    What are exceptions and how to use them
    When do we need to use exceptions
    How to correctly handle an exception
    What’s the purpose of catching exceptions
    How to raise a builtin exception
    When do we need to implement a clean-up action after an exception


### Tasks:

| Name | Description                    |
| ------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `0. Safe list printing `      | function that prints x elements of a list.       |
| `div()`   | divides the second top element of the stack by the top element of the stack.     |
| `mod()`      | computes the rest of the division of the second top element of the stack by the top element of the stack.       |
| `mul()`      | multiplies the second top element of the stack with the top element of the stack.       |
| `nop()`      | doesn’t do anything.       |
| `pall()`      | prints all the values on the stack, starting from the top of the stack.       |
| `pchar()`      | prints the char at the top of the stack, followed by a new line.       |
| `pint()`      |  prints the value at the top of the stack, followed by a new line.       |
| `pop()`      | removes the top element of the stack.       |
| `pstr()`      | prints the string starting at the top of the stack, followed by a new line.       |
| `push()`      | pushes an element to the stack.  Usage: push <<n>>       |
| `rotl()`      | rotates the stack to the top.       |
| `rotr()`      | rotates the stack to the bottom.       |
| `sub()`      | subtracts the top element of the stack from the second top element of the stack.       |
| `swap()`      |  swaps the top two elements of the stack.       |
