    Why Python programming is awesome (don’t forget to tweet today, with the hashtag #pythoniscool :))
    What is an object
    What is the difference between a class and an object or instance
    What is the difference between immutable object and mutable object
    What is a reference
    What is an assignment
    What is an alias
    How to know if two variables are identical
    How to know if two variables are linked to the same object
    How to display the variable identifier (which is the memory address in the CPython implementation)
    What is mutable and immutable
    What are the built-in mutable types
    What are the built-in immutable types
    How does Python pass variables to functions


### Tasks:

0. Who I am?

 What function would you use to print the type of an object? Write the
 name of the function in the file, without the ()

1. Where are you?

 How to get variable identifier (which is the memory address in the
 CPython implementation)? Write the name of the function in the file,
 without the ()

2. Right count

 In the following code, do a and b point to the same object?
 Answer with Yes or No.

 >>> a = 89
 >>> b = 100

3. Right count =

 In the following code, do a and b point to the same object?
 Answer with Yes or No.

 >>> a = 89
 >>> b = 89

4. Right count =

 In the following code, do a and b point to the same object?
 Answer with Yes or No.

 >>> a = 89
 >>> b = a

5. Right count =+

 In the following code, do a and b point to the same object?
 Answer with Yes or No.

 >>> a = 89
 >>> b = a + 1

6. Is equal

 What should those 3 lines print:

 >>> s1 = "Holberton"
 >>> s2 = s1
 >>> print(s1 == s2)

7. Is the same

 What should those 3 lines print:

 >>> s1 = "Holberton"
 >>> s2 = s1
 >>> print(s1 is s2)

8. Is really equal

 What should those 3 lines print:

 >>> s1 = "Holberton"
 >>> s2 = "Holberton"
 >>> print(s1 == s2)

9. Is really the same

 What should those 3 lines print:

 >>> s1 = "Holberton"
 >>> s2 = "Holberton"
 >>> print(s1 is s2)

10. And with a list, is it equal

  What should those 3 lines print:

  >>> l1 = [1, 2, 3]
  >>> l2 = [1, 2, 3]
  >>> print(l1 == l2)

11. And with a list, is it the same

  What should those 3 lines print:

  >>> l1 = [1, 2, 3]
  >>> l2 = [1, 2, 3]
  >>> print(l1 is l2)

12. And with a list, is it really equal

  What should those 3 lines print:

  >>> l1 = [1, 2, 3]
  >>> l2 = l1
  >>> print(l1 == l2)

13. And with a list, is it really the same

  What should print those 3 lines:

  >>> l1 = [1, 2, 3]
  >>> l2 = l1
  >>> print(l1 is l2)

14. List append

  What does this script print?

  l1 = [1, 2, 3]
  l2 = l1
  l1.append(4)
  print(l2)

15. List add

  What does this script print?

  l1 = [1, 2, 3]
  l2 = l1
  l1 = l1 + [4]
  print(l2)

16. Integer incrementation

  What does this script print?

  def increment(n):
  	  n += 1
  a = 1
  increment(a)
  print(a)

17. List incrementation

  What does this script print?

  def increment(n):
  	  n.append(4)

  l = [1, 2, 3]
  increment(l)
  print(l)

18. List assignation

  What does this script print?

  def assign_value(n, v):
  	  n = v

  l1 = [1, 2, 3]
  l2 = [4, 5, 6]
  assign_value(l1, l2)
  print(l1)

19. Copy a list object

  Write a function def copy_list(l): that returns a copy of a list.

    The input list can contain any type of objects
    Your file should be maximum 3-line long (no documentation needed)
    You are not allowed to import any module

20. Tuple or not?

  a = ()
  Is 'a' a tuple? Answer with Yes or No.

21. Tuple or not?

  a = (1, 2)
  Is 'a' a tuple? Answer with Yes or No.

22. Tuple or not?

  a = (1)
  Is 'a' a tuple? Answer with Yes or No.

23. Tuple or not?

  a = (1, )
  Is 'a' a tuple? Answer with Yes or No.

24. Richard Sim's special #0

  What does this script print?

  a = (1)
  b = (1)
  a is b

25. Richard Sim's special #1

  What does this script print?

  a = (1, 2)
  b = (1, 2)
  a is b

26. Richard Sim's special #2

  What does this script print?

  a = ()
  b = ()
  a is b

27. Richard Sim's special #3

  >>> id(a)
  139926795932424
  >>> a
  [1, 2, 3, 4]
  >>> a = a + [5]
  >>> id(a)

28. Richard Sim's special #4

  >>> a
  [1, 2, 3]
  >>> id (a)
  139926795932424
  >>> a += [4]
  >>> id(a)
